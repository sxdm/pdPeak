## pdPeak
This MATLAB set of scripts computes the pdPeak estimate, a method described in Sasaki et al. 2021.

The pdPeak method was developed to estimate the level of sexual size dimorphism from metric data without associated sex information. 
This method assumes a model of a balanced mixture of two homoscedastic normal distributions of a log-transformed size variable, and provides the estimate of the ratio between the sex means as the point at which the posterior probability density of the distance between the two distributions is highest.
